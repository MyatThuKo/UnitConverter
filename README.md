<h1> Unit Converter </h1>
<h4> NOTE: This app will be updating with new conversions in future when I learn about navigation between pages and forms. </h4>
<p> This is Day 19 of 100 Days of SwiftUI project. Today is a challenge day. 
The challenge is to create an app that do unit conversion. I decided to do Temperature Conversion.

</p>
<h2> Update: June 3, 2020 </h2> 
<p> Finished adding other factors for this conversion. In addition to Temperature, Length, Volume and Time are also available. 
  I use 
  <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-units-using-unit-and-measurement" target="_blank"> Measurement </a> for Length and Volume conversions. 
</p>
<p>
This app is built using the followings. 
  <ol> 
    <li> Navigation Link</li>
    <li> Picker </li>
    <li> Measurement </li>
  </ol>
