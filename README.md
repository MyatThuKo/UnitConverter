<h1> Unit Converter </h1>
<h4> NOTE: This app will be updating with new conversions in future when I learn about navigation between pages and forms. </h4>
<p> This is Day 19 of 100 Days of SwiftUI project. Today is a challenge day. 
The challenge is to create an app that do unit conversion. I decided to do Temperature Conversion.

</p>
<p> The challenges that I faced while building this app were 
<ol>
<li> How to use @State </li>
<li> How to do data binding from the selection </li> 
</ol> 
<p> The app runs successfully after 3 hours of researching and coding </p>
<p><i><b> For the app icon, I use https://www.canva.com/ and https://appicon.co/ </b></i></p>
